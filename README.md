# Penguin Classification and Analysis

This repository provides a complete pipeline for penguin species classification using various machine learning techniques. The dataset contains key features of penguins such as bill dimensions, flipper length, body mass, and island habitat. The goal is to classify penguin species and analyze the predictive power of features.

## Features of the Repository
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  Gain insights into the dataset through visualizations such as pair plots, histograms, and boxplots.
  
- **Feature Selection**

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  Train and evaluate multiple models:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Gaussian Naive Bayes**

- **Performance Evaluation:**
  Compare models using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and ROC/Precision-Recall curves.

- **Visualizations:**
  Visualize decision boundaries, ROC curves, feature importances.
